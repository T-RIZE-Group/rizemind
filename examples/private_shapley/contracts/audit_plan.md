# PrivateShapley Contract Audit & Testing Plan

## 1. Contract Analysis & Documentation

### 1.1 Risk Assessment

- [✓] Identify critical functions and attack vectors

## 2. Static Analysis

### 2.1 Manual Code Review

- [✓] Line-by-line code review with detailed notes
- [✓] Check for common vulnerabilities (reentrancy, front-running, etc.)
- [✓] Review arithmetic operations for over/underflows
- [✓] Analyze access control mechanisms

## 3. Test Suite Development

### 3.1 Unit Tests

- [✓] Test registration functions (registerTrainers, setTesters)
- [✓] Test coalition lifecycle (commit, publish, reveal)
- [✓] Test reward claiming mechanisms
- [✓] Test edge cases and boundary conditions

### 3.2 Integration Tests

- [✓] Test full contract workflow with multiple actors
- [✓] Test integration with token contract
- [ ] Test realistic scenarios with different coalition compositions

### 3.3 Fuzz Tests

- [✓] Develop property-based tests for invariant checking

## 4. Gas Optimization Analysis

### 4.1 Function-Level Gas Analysis

- [✓] Measure gas consumption for all public functions
- [✓] Identify hotspots and optimization opportunities
- [✓] Benchmark different input sizes

### 4.2 Optimization Recommendations

- [✓] Propose storage optimizations
- [✓] Suggest algorithmic improvements
- [✓] Calculate gas savings from proposed changes

## 5. Security Recommendations

### 5.1 Vulnerability Mitigation
